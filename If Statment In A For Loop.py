# # Step 1: Create a list of the grossest foods and assign it to a variable named foods

# # Step 2: Loop through the list named foods using a for loop
# for food in foods:
#     # Step 3: Use an if statement to check if the item is equal to "mushrooms"
#     if food == "mushrooms":
#         print(food + " are gross")  # Concatenated sentence for mushrooms
    
#     # Step 4: Use an elif statement to check if the item is equal to "broccoli"
#     elif food == "broccoli":
#         print(food + " is gross")  # Concatenated sentence for broccoli
    
#     # Step 5: Use an elif statement to check if the item is equal to "fish"
#     elif food == "fish":
#         print(food + " is gross")  # Concatenated sentence for fish
    
#     # Step 7: Use an else statement to handle any items not in the above categories
