#     people_in_line = people_in_line - 1

#     - Every time the loop runs, the variable named people_in_line is subtracted by one.

# INCREMENT OPERATOR
# ->  An increment operator works the same way as a decrement operator.  The increment simply adds to the variable instead of subtracting.

# people_in_line = people_in_line + 1

# people_in_line += 1

# WHILE LOOP EXSAMPLE
# ->  * Let's say you wanted to write a program where the user can input their age and the loop will print out all the numbers below their age. We can use a while loop to do this!
# age = 17

# while age >+ 0: 
#     print(age)
#     age -= 1

# WHILE LOOPS
